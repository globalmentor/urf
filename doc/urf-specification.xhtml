    <h1>Uniform Resource Framework (URF)</h1>

    <p>Copyright © 2007 GlobalMentor, Inc. This specification may be freely
    used but only in unmodifed form.</p>

    <p>Editor: Garret Wilson</p>

    <p>Version 2007-09-01</p>

    <p>The Uniform Resource Framework (URF) provides a consistent way for
    representing resources and their relationships. URF and its interchange
    formats are useful for data storage, data interchange, data querying, and
    logical inferences. URF together with its interchange formats provides a
    more powerful yet in many ways simpler and more consistent replacement for
    data-oriented XML, RDF, and JSON.</p>

    <p>This document defines the Uniform Resource Framework (URF) as an
    abstract model, and also defines a text-based representation format, Text
    URF (TURF). This document does not yet provide a description of the binary
    representation format Serial URF (SURF), or the XML-based format XML URF
    (XMURF).</p>

    <h2>Conventions</h2>

    <p>When this document refers to "URF", it indicates the URF model abstract
    from any representation format. When this document refers to "TURF", it
    indicates the textual representation of URF. Because abstract concepts
    must be textualized to be communicated in a text-based specification, at
    times a description of the URF abstract model will use TURF notation for
    clarification of the model.</p>

    <h2>Primer</h2>

    <h3>Resources</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>URF</dt>

      <dd><p>Everything that can be described by URF is referred to as a
      <dfn>resource</dfn>. Every resource is an instance of the class
      <code>(&lt;:urf:#Resource&gt;)</code>.</p></dd>

      <dt>TURF</dt>

      <dd><p>A resource can be indicated by parentheses. Multiple resources
      are separated by commas. The following example refers to an anonymous
      resource:</p><blockquote>
          <pre><code>()</code></pre>
        </blockquote><p>A resource can optionally be given a label which can
      be used as a short representation to refer the resource only within the
      interchange document. A resource label is a series of name characters
      (TODO define name characters) placed in front of a resource description
      and surrounded by colons, as in the following example:</p><blockquote>
          <pre><code>:label:()</code></pre>
        </blockquote></dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Resource Identification</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>URF</dt>

      <dd><p>A resource may be <dfn>anonymous</dfn> or may be identified by
      one or more URIs.</p></dd>

      <dt>TURF</dt>

      <dd><p>A URI is indicated by angle brackets. The following example
      indicates the URI represented by the characters
      <code>http://example.org/example#resource</code>:</p><blockquote>
          <pre><code>&lt;http://example.org/example#resource&gt;</code></pre>
        </blockquote><p>A resource may be identified by placing its URI within
      the resource parentheses; if there is more than one identifying URI,
      they are separated by commas. The following example refers to a resource
      identified by the URI
      <code>&lt;http://urf.name/urf#resource&gt;</code>.</p><blockquote>
          <pre><code>(&lt;http://example.org/example#resource&gt;)</code></pre>
        </blockquote><p>All URIs may be relative references, which are
      resolved to the base URI of the interchange document. URIs that have
      been given a label may also be used as a base reference against which
      the rest of the relative reference is resolved, by placing the base URI
      label at the beginning of the relative reference. The following example
      uses a labeled URI, defined in the first line, as a base URI in the
      second line to resolve into the same resource identified
      above:</p><blockquote>
          <pre><code>:example:&lt;http://example.org/example&gt;,
(&lt;:example:#resource&gt;)</code></pre>
        </blockquote></dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Namespaces</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>URF</dt>

      <dd><p>A set of resources (those part of a particular
      <dfn>ontology</dfn>, for example) may be grouped together for
      identification purposes by using a common <dfn>namespace</dfn>. A
      namespace is a URI that serves as a base for the formation of URIs
      within that namespace. If a resource lies within a namespace, the
      resource's <var>local name</var> is the part appearing after the pound
      sign in the URI fragment identifier. A namespace URI therefore may not
      have a fragment identifier. A URI within a namespace is formed by
      appending a pound sign followed by the resource's local name to the
      namespace URI. This allows the namespace and local name to be
      unambiguously determined given any URI within a namespace. For example,
      the URI <code>&lt;http://urf.name/urf#Resource&gt;</code> is within the
      namespace <code>&lt;http://urf.name/urf&gt;</code>. Not all resource
      URIs are part of some namespace.</p></dd>

      <dt>TURF</dt>

      <dd><p>TURF facilitates identification of a resource within a namespace
      using the URI resolution process described above. If
      <code>&lt;http://example.org/example&gt;</code> identifies a namespace
      and is given the label <code>example</code>, for example, the reference
      <code>(&lt;:example:#resource&gt;)</code> would indicate the same
      resource as would the reference
      <code>(&lt;http://example.org/example#resource&gt;)</code>.</p></dd>
    </dl>

    <p>This specification uses resources in the following namespaces, with
    corresponding labels:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>:example:&lt;http://example.org/example&gt;</code></dt>

      <dd>An example namespace; used for hypothetical situations.</dd>

      <dt><code>:index:&lt;urn:urf:index&gt;</code></dt>

      <dd>The URF namespace for properties representing indexes of arrays and
      other resources.</dd>

      <dt><code>:urf:&lt;http://www.urf.name/urf&gt;</code></dt>

      <dd>The URF namespace for resource and properties related to the
      framework abstract model itself.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Properties</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>URF</dt>

      <dd><p>A resource may be related to another resource by the use of a
      <dfn>property</dfn>. Every property is itself a resource and is an
      instance of the class <code>(&lt;:urf:#Property&gt;)</code>. A resource
      <dfn>subject</dfn>, a property <dfn>predicate</dfn>, and the related
      resource <dfn>object</dfn> together make an <dfn>assertion</dfn> about
      the universe being described.</p><p>An infinite number of assertions may
      be made about a single subject resource. An infinite number of these
      assertions may use the same predicate property and/or the same object
      resource. Within a particular context, the relative order of assertions
      about any particular resource subject is maintained.</p></dd>

      <dt>TURF</dt>

      <dd><p>Assertions about a particular subject resource are presented, in
      order, within angle brackets and separated by commas. Each predicate
      property and object resource pair of an assertion are separated by an
      equals character. Object resources, like resources in other contexts,
      can serve as the subject of other property assertions. In the following
      example, the resource
      <code>(&lt;http://example.org/example#resource&gt;)</code> has a single
      property <code>(&lt;http://example.org/example#property&gt;)</code>,
      which has as its value another resource,
      <code>(&lt;http://example.org/example#value&gt;)</code>:</p><blockquote>
          <pre><code>(&lt;http://example.org/example#resource&gt;)
{
  (&lt;http://example.org/example#property&gt;)=(&lt;http://example.org/example#value&gt;)
}</code></pre>
        </blockquote><p>Were the label <code>example</code> defined to
      indicate the namespace <code>&lt;http://example.org/example&gt;</code>,
      the above example could be represented in the following shorthand
      representation:</p><blockquote>
          <pre><code>:example:&lt;http://example.org/example&gt;,
(&lt;:example:#resource&gt;)
{
  (&lt;:example:#property&gt;)=(&lt;:example:#value&gt;)
}</code></pre>
        </blockquote></dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Classes</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>URF</dt>

      <dd><p>A resource may represent a <dfn>class</dfn> or set of resources
      containing instances of other resources. As stated earlier, for example,
      all resources are implicitly instances of the class
      <code>(&lt;:urf:#Resource&gt;)</code>, and all property resources are
      also implicitly instances of the class
      <code>(&lt;:urf:#Property&gt;)</code>. Any resource may be explicitly
      asserted to be an instance of some class by identifying the class
      resource as a value of the <code>(&lt;:urf:#type&gt;)</code>
      property.</p></dd>

      <dt>TURF</dt>

      <dd><p>It can be asserted that a resource is an instance of a class by
      normal representation of the <code>(&lt;:urf:#type&gt;)</code> property.
      In the following example, the resource
      <code>(&lt;:example:#resource&gt;)</code> is asserted to be an instance
      of the class <code>(&lt;:example:#Class&gt;)</code>:</p><blockquote>
          <pre><code>:urf:&lt;http://www.urf.name/urf&gt;,
:example:&lt;http://example.org/example&gt;,
(&lt;:example:#resource&gt;)
{
  (&lt;:urf:#type&gt;)=(&lt;:example:#Class&gt;),
  (&lt;:example:#property&gt;)=(&lt;:example:#value&gt;)
}</code></pre>
        </blockquote><p>As a shorthand representation, that a resource is an
      instance of one or more classes may be represented by placing the class
      resource after the identification of the instance resource, surrounding
      the class resource reference by the <code>'^'</code> character. Multiple
      classes may be separated by commas. The following example is
      semantically identical to the preceding example:</p><blockquote>
          <pre><code>:example:&lt;http://example.org/example&gt;,
(&lt;:example:#resource&gt;)^(&lt;:example:#Class&gt;)^
{
  (&lt;:example:#property&gt;)=(&lt;:example:#value&gt;)
}</code></pre>
        </blockquote></dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>URF Types</h3>

    <p>URF comes with several built-in types:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>(&lt;:urf:#Array&gt;)</code></dt>

      <dd>Array resources are resources that contain other <dfn>element</dfn>
      resources at certain <dfn>indexes</dfn> of the array. An array, like
      normal resources, may have any property, but the properties representing
      the contents of the array lie in the <code>&lt;urn:urf:index&gt;</code>
      namespace, each with a local name of the canonical lexical form of the
      integer index of the element. That is, if an array contains an element
      at index 5, the element resource will appear as a value of the property
      <code>(&lt;urn:urf:index#5&gt;)</code>. Although many uses cases will
      prefer a continuous, unduplicated sequence of index properties beginning
      with <code>(&lt;urn:urf:index#0&gt;)</code>, this is not an URF
      requirement.</dd>

      <dt><code>(&lt;:urf:#Boolean&gt;)</code></dt>

      <dd>There are two boolean resources, the values <code>true</code> and
      <code>false</code>. Boolean resources are identified by lexical
      namespace URIs with lexical representations of <code>"true"</code> and
      <code>"false"</code>, respectively. (TODO refer to
      http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#boolean)</dd>

      <dt><code>(&lt;:urf:#Character&gt;)</code></dt>

      <dd>Character resources are the Unicode code points, and their lexical
      forms are the Unicode characters represented by those code points.</dd>

      <dt><code>(&lt;:urf:#Date&gt;)</code></dt>

      <dd>Date resources are particular points in time up to (TODO decide
      accuracy) accuracy. (TODO reference ISO and W3C date
      specifications)</dd>

      <dt><code>(&lt;:urf:#Float&gt;)</code></dt>

      <dd>Float resources are floating point numbers, represented by lexical
      forms containing a period as a decimal separator and an optional
      exponent. (TODO further define format, including case of "e") (TODO
      refer to http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#float and
      http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#double)</dd>

      <dt><code>(&lt;:urf:#Integer&gt;)</code></dt>

      <dd>Integer resources are integer numbers, represented by roman digits
      with no decimal. (TODO refer to XMLSchema)</dd>

      <dt><code>(&lt;:urf:#Property&gt;)</code></dt>

      <dd>Every property is implicitly an instance of the class
      <code>urf:Property</code>.</dd>

      <dt><code>(&lt;:urf:#RegularExpression&gt;)</code></dt>

      <dd>Regular expression resources text-based patterns that define rules
      for the content of strings.</dd>

      <dt><code>(&lt;:urf:#Resource&gt;)</code></dt>

      <dd>Every resource is implicitly an instance of the class
      <code>urf:Resource</code>. The resources <code>urf:Property</code> and
      <code>urf:Resource</code> are both instances of the class
      <code>urf:Resource</code>.</dd>

      <dt><code>(&lt;:urf:#String&gt;)</code></dt>

      <dd>String resources are sequences of Unicode code points or text.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Lexical Namespaces</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>URF</dt>

      <dd><p>Some resource types contain one, many, or an infinite number of
      resources that in day-to-day life have customarily been identified by
      character sequences or <dfn><dfn>lexical representations</dfn></dfn>.
      For example, the integer <code>123</code> has historically been
      represented by the character sequence <code>"123"</code>, although the
      number itself is an abstract concept, not a series of characters.
      Similarly, the two boolean values are usually represented as the
      character sequences <code>"true"</code> and <code>"false"</code>. URF
      provides for a series of namespaces to identify resources that are
      typically identified by lexical representations. Each lexical namespace
      is a URN (TODO cite RFC 2141) with an NSS of <code>urf</code>, and have
      the following format,</p><blockquote>
          <pre><code>urn:urf:lex:<var>encodedTypeURI</var>#<var>encodedLexicalForm</var></code></pre>
        </blockquote><p>where <var>encodedTypeURI</var> is the URI-encoded
      form of the full type URI of the resource, and
      <var>encodedLexicalForm</var> is the URI-encoded canonical lexical form
      of the resource as defined by the indicated type. For example, the
      integer 123, which is of the type
      <code>(&lt;http://urf.name/urf#Integer&gt;)</code>, is represented in
      URF using the following URI:</p><blockquote>
          <pre><code>urn:urf:lex:http%3A%2F%2Furf.name%2Furf%23Integer#123</code></pre>
        </blockquote><p>A resource in a lexical namespace is implicitly an
      instance of the type indicated in the <var>encodedTypeURI</var> section
      of the URI. In all other aspects resources in lexical namespaces are no
      different from resources not in a lexical namespace; these resources are
      <em>not</em> instances of a special resource type solely because their
      namespaces are lexical namespaces. Lexical namespaces provide a
      framework for easily and consistently formulating identifying URIs for
      resources that are traditionally identified in lexical form; lexical
      namespaces in themselves imply no additional semantics.</p></dd>

      <dt>TURF</dt>

      <dd><p>A resource in a lexical namespace can be identified by its URI as
      with any other resource. For example, the integer 123 can be identified
      by its URI
      <code>&lt;urn:urf:lex:http%3A%2F%2Furf.name%2Furf%23Integer#123&gt;</code>
      as in the following example:</p><blockquote>
          <pre><code>(&lt;urn:urf:lex:http%3A%2F%2Furf.name%2Furf%23Integer#123&gt;)</code></pre>
        </blockquote><p>A resource in a lexical namespace can also be
      identified by indicating the resource type as well as using a reference
      of a string, rather than a URI, containing the canonical lexical form of
      the resource. The integer 123 may therefore be represented in the
      following short form:</p><blockquote>
          <pre><code>("123")^(&lt;:urf:#Integer&gt;)^</code></pre>
        </blockquote><p>The lexical namespaces for several types have
      additional short representations.</p><dl>
          <dt><code>(&lt;:urf:#Boolean&gt;)</code></dt>

          <dd><p>An boolean resource may be identified by its lexical form
          without surrounding quotes. For example, the following short
          representation,</p><blockquote>
              <pre><code>true</code></pre>
            </blockquote><p>is equivalent to the following long
          representation,</p><blockquote>
              <pre><code>(&lt;urn:urf:lex:http%3A%2F%2Furf.name%2Furf%23Boolean#true&gt;)</code></pre>
            </blockquote><p>which is also equivalent to the following general
          short representation for resources in a lexical
          namespace:</p><blockquote>
              <pre><code>("true")^(&lt;:urf:#Boolean&gt;)^</code></pre>
            </blockquote></dd>

          <dt><code>(&lt;:urf:#Character&gt;)</code></dt>

          <dd><p>A character resource may be identified by its string-escaped
          (TODO define string escaping) lexical form with surrounding single
          quotes. For example, the following short
          representation,</p><blockquote>
              <pre><code>'x'</code></pre>
            </blockquote><p>is equivalent to the following long
          representation,</p><blockquote>
              <pre><code>(&lt;urn:urf:lex:http%3A%2F%2Furf.name%2Furf%23Character#x&gt;)</code></pre>
            </blockquote><p>which is also equivalent to the following general
          short representation for resources in a lexical
          namespace:</p><blockquote>
              <pre><code>("x")^(&lt;:urf:#Character&gt;)^</code></pre>

          <dt><code>(&lt;:urf:#Date&gt;)</code></dt>

          and W3C date format) lexical form with surrounding at signs
          (<code>'@'</code>). For example, the following short

              <pre><code>@1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00@</code></pre>
            </blockquote><p>is equivalent to the following long representation

            </blockquote><p>which is also equivalent to the general short
          representation for resources in a lexical namespace:</p><blockquote>
              <pre><code>("1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00")^(&lt;:urf:#Date&gt;)^</code></pre>
            </blockquote></dd>

          <dd><p>A float resource may be identified by its lexical form

          representation,</p><blockquote>
              <pre><code>123.0</code></pre>
            </blockquote><p>is equivalent to the following long

              <pre><code>("apple")^(&lt;:urf:#String&gt;)^</code></pre>

          <dd><p>A URI resource may be identified by its string-escaped (TODO
          define string escaping) lexical form with surrounding angle brackets
          <code>'&lt;'</code> and <code>'&gt;'</code>. For example, the
          following short representation,</p><blockquote>
              <pre><code>&lt;http://urf.name/urf#type&gt;</code></pre>
            </blockquote><p>is equivalent to the following long
          representation,</p><blockquote>
              <pre><code>(&lt;urn:urf:lex:http%3A%2F%2Furf.name%2Furf%23URI#http%3A%2F%2Furf.name%2Furf%23type&gt;)</code></pre>
            </blockquote><p>which is also equivalent to the general short
          representation for resources in a lexical namespace:</p><blockquote>
              <pre><code>("http://urf.name/urf#type")^(&lt;:urf:#URI&gt;)^</code></pre>
            </blockquote></dd>

    <h3>Contextual Properties</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>URF</dt>

      <dd>Some resource properties should only be considered to be asserted in
      the context of the relationship between two other resources. A
      contextual property has as its context its subject resource, along with
      the the property and corresponding subject resource of which the
      contextual property's subject resource is a value. For example, if Juan
      has an English name of <code>"John"</code>, Juan could specify a
      <code>(&lt;:example:#name&gt;)</code> of <code>"John"</code> with an
      <code>(&lt;:example:#lang&gt;)</code> of
      <code>("en")^(&lt;:example:#Language&gt;)^</code>. Because the string
      <code>"John"</code> may not represent an English string in all contexts,
      its property <code>(&lt;:example:#lang&gt;)</code> should be considered
      contextual to the relationship between Juan and the
      <code>(&lt;:example:#name&gt;)</code> "John".</dd>

      <dt>TURF</dt>

      <dd>A contextual property is indicated by using the character
      <code>'~'</code> in place of the character <code>'='</code> in a
      property definition. The following example illustrates Juan indicating
      an English name of John:<blockquote>
          <pre><code>:example:&lt;http://example.org/example&gt;,
{
  (&lt;:example:#name&gt;)="John"
  {
    (&lt;:example:#lang&gt;)~("en")^(&lt;:example:#Language&gt;)^
  }
}</code></pre>
        </blockquote></dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>TURF</h2>

    <p>TURF is the text interchange format for URF. TURF emphasizes terseness
    and consistency while maintaining human readability, with a preference for
    using symbols from existing interchange formats such as JSON and
    programming languages such as Java and C#.</p>

    <h3>Grammar</h3>

    <p>The following grammar indicates literals in normal style, variables in
    emphasized text, and grammar symbols in strong text.</p>

    <p>Any two TURF tokens may be separated by break, whitespace, and
    separator Unicode characters.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code><var>SEPARATOR</var> ⇒ Unicode Paragraph Separator | Unicode Segment Separator | Unicode Whitespace</code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A TURF interchange document is encoded in UTF-8, and is composed of one
    or more resource descriptions, separated by commas.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code><var>TURF</var> ⇒ <var>resource</var><strong>[</strong>,<var>resource</var><strong>]*</strong></code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Each resource description must have at least one of the following
    optional components: a label, a reference, a type, and a set of property
    definitions</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code><var>resource</var> ⇒ <strong>[</strong>:<var>label</var>:<strong>][</strong><var>reference</var><strong>][</strong>^<var>type</var>^<strong>][</strong>{<var>properties</var>}<strong>]</strong></code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A label consists of one or more name characters.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code><var>label</var> ⇒ <var>namechar</var><strong>+</strong></code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A name character is any letter, digit, hyphen, or underscore.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code><var>namechar</var> ⇒ <var>Unicode Uppercase Letter</var> <strong>|</strong> <var>Unicode Lowercase Letter</var> <strong>|</strong> <var>Unicode Decimal Number</var> <strong>|</strong> - <strong>|</strong> _</code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A resource reference is normally its URI enclosed in parentheses, but
    may also be the lexical form of a resource in a lexical namespace or one
    of several short representations.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code><var>reference</var> ⇒ (<strong>[</strong><var>urishort</var><strong>[,</strong>urishort<strong>]*]</strong>)<strong>|</strong>(<var>stringshort</var>)<strong>|</strong><var>urishort</var><strong>|</strong><var>stringshort</var><strong>|</strong><var>booleanshort</var><strong>|</strong><var>charshort</var><strong>|</strong><var>arrayshort</var><strong>|</strong><var>regexshort</var><strong>|</strong><var>dateshort</var></code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Any reference that uses the form <code>(<var>stringshort</var>)</code>
    is referencing a resource in a lexical namespace, equivalent to a resource
    with a URI in the form
    <code>urn:urf:lex:<var>encodedTypeURI</var>#<var>encodedLexicalForm</var></code>.
    If there is no explicitly defined type, the resource's type will default
    to <code>(&lt;:urf:#String&gt;)</code>.</p>

    <p>A string short form is a sequence of Unicode characters, using the
    backslash as an escape character, enclosed in double quotes. The double
    quotation mark (<code>'"'</code>), backslash (<code>'\\'</code>), and
    every Unicode control character must be escaped. Any Unicode code point
    may be represented by four uppercase or lowercase hexadecimal
    representation following the character sequence <code>"\u"</code>, or if
    the code point is not in the Basic Multilingual Plane, two such sequences
    representing UTF-16 surrogate pair. A string short form is equivalent to a
    resource of type <code>^(&lt;:urf:#String&gt;)^</code> using the
    corresponding lexical namespace. The string short form
    <code>"example"</code> is the equivalent of the string resource
    <code>("example")^(&lt;:urf:#String&gt;)^</code>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code><var>stringshort</var> ⇒ "<strong>[</strong><var>Unicode character except double quote, backslash, and control</var> <strong>|</strong> \" <strong>|</strong> \\ <strong>|</strong> \b <strong>|</strong> \t <strong>|</strong> \r <strong>|</strong> \n <strong>|</strong> \f <strong>|</strong> \u<var>XXXX</var><strong>]*</strong>"</code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A character short form is a single Unicode characters, using the
    backslash as an escape character, enclosed in a single quote. The single
    quote (<code>'\''</code>), backslash (<code>'\\'</code>), and every
    Unicode control character must be escaped. Any Unicode code point may be
    represented by four uppercase or lowercase hexadecimal representation
    following the character sequence <code>"\u"</code>, or if the code point
    is not in the Basic Multilingual Plane, two such sequences representing
    UTF-16 surrogate pair. A string short form is equivalent to a resource of
    type <code>^(&lt;:urf:#Character&gt;)^</code> using the corresponding
    lexical namespace. The character short form <code>'x'</code> is the
    equivalent of the character resource
    <code>("x")^(&lt;:urf:#Character&gt;)^</code>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code><var>charshort</var> ⇒ '<strong>[</strong><var>Unicode character except single quote, backslash, and control</var> <strong>|</strong> \' <strong>|</strong> \\ <strong>|</strong> \b <strong>|</strong> \t <strong>|</strong> \r <strong>|</strong> \n <strong>|</strong> \f <strong>|</strong> \u<var>XXXX</var><strong>]*</strong>'</code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A URI short form is a sequence of character constituting a
    syntactically correct URI or a relative reference, surrounded by the angle
    brackets <code>'&lt;'</code> and <code>'&gt;'</code>. If a relative
    reference is provided, it is resolved against the base URi of the TURF
    document. If a label appears at the beginning of the URI characters and
    that label refers to a previously defined URI resource, the remaining
    characters are interpreted as a relative reference and resolved against
    the URI to which the label refers. A single relative reference is resolved
    to the base URI of the interchange document. A URI short form is
    equivalent to a resource of type <code>^(&lt;:urf:#URI&gt;)^</code> using
    the corresponding lexical namespace. The URI short form
    <code>&lt;http://example.org&gt;</code> is the equivalent of the URI
    resource <code>("http://example.org")^&lt;:urf:#URI&gt;)^</code>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code><var>urishort</var> ⇒ &lt;<strong>[</strong>:label:<strong>]</strong><var>urichar</var><strong>+</strong>&gt;</code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A boolean short form is character sequence <code>true</code> or
    <code>false</code>. A boolean short form is equivalent to a resource of
    type <code>^(&lt;:urf:#Boolean&gt;)^</code> using the corresponding
    lexical namespace. The boolean short form <code>true</code> is the
    equivalent of the boolean resource
    <code>("true")^&lt;:urf:#Boolean&gt;)^</code>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code><var>booleanshort</var> ⇒ true<strong>|</strong>false</code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A regular expression short form is a sequence of Unicode characters,
    using the backslash as an escape character, enclosed in forward slash
    (<code>'/'</code>) characters. The clash character (<code>'/'</code>),
    backslash (<code>'\\'</code>), and every Unicode control character must be
    escaped. Any Unicode code point may be represented by four uppercase or
    lowercase hexadecimal representation following the character sequence
    <code>"\u"</code>, or if the code point is not in the Basic Multilingual
    Plane, two such sequences representing UTF-16 surrogate pair. A regular
    expression short form is equivalent to a resource of type
    <code>^(&lt;:urf:#RegularExpression&gt;)^</code> using the corresponding
    lexical namespace. The regular expression short form <code>"a?b+c*"</code>
    is the equivalent of the string resource
    <code>("a?b+c*")^(&lt;:urf:#RegularExpression&gt;)^</code>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code><var>regexshort</var> ⇒ "<strong>[</strong><var>Unicode character except slash, backslash, and control</var> <strong>|</strong> \/ <strong>|</strong> \\ <strong>|</strong> \b <strong>|</strong> \t <strong>|</strong> \r <strong>|</strong> \n <strong>|</strong> \f <strong>|</strong> \u<var>XXXX</var><strong>]*</strong>"</code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>An array short form consists of a bracketed sequence of element
    resources separated by commas. Each listed element resource represents the
    value of an index property, in sequence beginning with
    <code>(&lt;urn:urf:index#0&gt;)</code>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code><var>arrayshort</var> ⇒ [<strong>[</strong>resource<strong>[</strong>,resource<strong>]*]</strong>]</code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Type consists of zero or more resource specifications between matching
    <code>'^'</code> characters, each indicating a type of the resource.
    Indicating a type in this manner is equivalent to indicating the type as
    the value of a <code>(&lt;:urf:#type&gt;)</code> property.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code><var>type</var> ⇒ ^<strong>[</strong><var>resource</var><strong>[,</strong><var>resource</var><strong>]*</strong>]^</code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Properties consist of a comma-separated list of predicate resource and
    object resource pairs. Within each of these pairs, the separator
    <code>'='</code> is used to denote normal properties, and the separator
    <code>'~'</code> is used to denote contextual properties in the context of
    the property's subject resource and its respective predicate resource and
    subject resource.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code><var>properties</var> ⇒ <strong>[</strong><var>property</var><strong>[,</strong><var>property</var><strong><strong>]*</strong>]</strong></code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code><var>property</var> ⇒ <var>resource</var><strong>(</strong>=<strong>|</strong>~<strong>)</strong><var>resource</var></code></pre>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Comparisons</h2>

    <h3>Differences between URF and JSON</h3>

    <p></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Any URF resource may be identified by a URI. JSON makes no provision
      for identifying resources.</li>

      <li>URF allows globally consistent semantic properties by identifying
      resources with URIs. JSON properties names are local and may clash with
      semantically distinct property names among resources.</li>

      <li>URF provides a system for grouping resources within a common
      namespace, with the management of control for those namespaces
      facilitated by the Internet domain name system. JSON properties cannot
      be so aportioned, making name clashes more likely.</li>

      <li>URF distinguishes between the number types
      <code>(&lt;http://urf.name/urf#Integer&gt;)</code> and
      <code>(&lt;http://urf.name/urf#Float&gt;)</code>. JSON only has one
      number type.</li>

      <li>URF has a character type,
      <code>(&lt;http://urf.name/urf#Character&gt;)</code>. JSON has no
      character type.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Differences between URF and RDF</h3>

    <p>URF is a semantic superset of RDF. Anything that can be represented by
    the RDF abstract syntax can be represented by the URF abstract model.
    Converting from URF to RDF is possible but would require special
    URF-related RDF ontologies to encapsulate the extra semantics built into
    the URF abstract model.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>URF considers all resources equal, providing for consistent
      identification and property designation of every resource. RDF considers
      certain resources, such as numbers and strings, to be of special
      <dfn>literal</dfn> resource types which are not identified by URIs (in
      contrast to all other non-literal resources) and to which properties
      cannot be given.</li>

      <li>The URF abstract model maintains the relative order of repeated
      properties for a particular resource within a particular context. RDF
      properties are unordered.</li>

      <li>URF provides for contextual properties. RDF has no such
      concept.</li>

      <li>URF allows a resource to be identified by multiple URIs. The default
      RDF abstract syntax has no facility for indicating that a single
      resource is identified by distinct URIs.</li>

      <li>URF has a character type,
      <code>(&lt;http://urf.name/urf#Character&gt;)</code>. RDF, which uses
      XML Schema data types (TODO cite), has no character type.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Differences between URF and XML</h3>

    <p></p>

    <h3>Differences between TURF and RDF/XML</h3>

    <p></p>

    <ul>
      <li>TURF allows any resource, including strings and other resources in
      lexical namespaces, to be labeled for later reference. RDF/XML does not
      allow so-called RDF literal resources to be labeled.</li>
    </ul>
