	<h1>Simple URF (SURF) Specification</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
	<p>SURF is a compact, text-based, human-readable persistence format. It is similar in purpose to JSON yet less verbose and more expressive, supporting for example a greater number of types. Moreover as one of the primary serializations (along with TURF) of the Uniform Resource Format (URF), it is compatible with rigorous semantic frameworks such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF).</p>
	<h3>Design Constraints</h3>
	<p>The following considerations were used to guide the creation of this specification:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>SURF must support the Unicode character set for text values.</li>
		<li>SURF should support the Unicode character set for identifiers and comments.</li>
		<li>SURF must use only ASCII characters for delimiters.</li>
		<li>All valid SURF documents must also be valid TURF documents, with the exception of introductory elements.</li>
		<li>SURF must allow for distinctions among vocabularies of identifiers.</li>
		<li>SURF must not require users to declare namespace URIs.</li>
	</ul>
